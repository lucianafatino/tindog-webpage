# Welcome to the TinDog Website

<p>This web page was created using basic concepts of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap that were teached by Dr. Angela Yu, during her Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG3@OCcj2b7ZHImr3NYyngeGbIJdOK2jtF7sapEEYKMj2a1H08fMsDIWK0y-yASHiq6S/">The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp</a>.</p>
<p>During the construction of this webpage, I could have more insights about basic topics that I didn't had before, like margins and paddings, table formatting, the different things that Bootstrap makes possible and much other things!!</p>
